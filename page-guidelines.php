    <h2>Donation Guidelines</h2>
    <p>We recognize that there are many different menstrual products on the market, and it could be challenging deciding what exactly to pick out! This page is dedicated to providing guidance on what we love to receive here at All Cycles. </p>
    <section>
        <h3>Pads</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unscented: The perfumes used in some pads can cause irritation.</li>
            <li>Long Wear or ‘Overnight’ Protection: 8 Hour+ Pads that are still thin are preferred.</li>
            <li>Regular: The next best thing to long wear pads.</li>
            <li>Wings or No Wings: Either are great. These are mainly a personal preference.</li>
            <li>Long Pads: These are great! Long pads are often needed by folks with larger bodies.</li>
            <li>All Natural/Organic: These are wonderful, but pricey. If you have the means to donate these, they will be appreciated — but we value donations of all types and price points equally.</li>
            <li>Opened Packages: We can accept opened packages of Pads as long as the pads themselves are individually wrapped.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h3>Tampons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unscented: The perfumes used in some tampons can cause irritation </li>
            <li>Regular, Super or Super Plus: These are protection levels, we’ll take all varieties!</li>
            <li>Applicator or No Applicator: Either! This is mostly an issue of personal preference and mobility. Some people like the “no applicator” versions because they create less waste and can easily be tucked into a pocket, but applicators are necessary for many folks with limited mobility.</li>
            <li>All Natural/Organic: These are wonderful, but pricey. If you have the means to donate these, they will be appreciated — but we value donations of all types and price points equally.</li>
            <li>Opened Packages: We can accept opened packages of Tampons as long as the tampons themselves are individually wrapped.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Underwear</h3>
        <p>We accept underwear of all styles and sizes! From women’s and men’s styles, and the smallest to largest adult sizes. Cotton fabric is the best as it is breathable and affordable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Second Hand Underwear: If you wouldn’t gift an item to a beloved friend — it’s probably not meant for our donation box either. Please, no donations of second hand underwear.</li>
            <li>“Period Panties”: Brands like Thinx, Dear Kate’s and FannyPants are producing super absorbent underwear specifically designed to be worn during your menstrual cycle.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Wipes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hand Wipes or Body Wipes: Some wipes are only for cleaning your hands while others can be used all over the body! Both are helpful and we accept donations of either.</li>
            <li>Travel Size or Value Packs: We accept both, but travel size are preferable because they can be easily tucked into a pocket or backpack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Menstrual Cups & Re-usable Pads</h3>
        <p>All Cycles is currently accepting these donations, but please be aware they will only be used to support the income insecure, and NOT the homeless. This is because they are not practical for many people who do not have regular access to washrooms or laundry facilities. Additionally, the long term use of these items can cause problems for anyone who does not have permanent housing and regularly travels with their belongings limited to what will fit in a backpack.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Please be aware that we only accept menstrual products, as these are rarely donated to shelters.</p>
